RESULTS
=======

After using these parameters:

| Parameter                        | Value    |
|:---------------------------------|:---------|
| Database Tested                  | feaux_db |
| Number of Trials                 | 100      |
| Length of Each Entry Field       | 10       |
| Number of Nodes in Cluster       | n/a      |
| # of StDev's Displayed in Graphs | 1        |
| Split Reads and Writes           | True     |
| Debug Mode                       | True     |
| Chaos Mode (Random Reads)        | False    |

These results were obtained:

| Operation   |   Average |   St. Dev. |   Max Time |   Min Time |   Range |
|:------------|----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|--------:|
| Writes      |   0.00490 |         15 |    0.00921 |    0.00098 | 0.00822 |
| Reads       |   0.00399 |         15 |    0.00643 |    0.00172 | 0.00471 |

This plot shows the normalized speeds of reads and writes over the course of the benchmark.  The data was normalized (i.e. any data points beyond 3 standard deviations of the mean were excluded).
