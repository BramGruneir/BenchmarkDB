RESULTS
=======

After using these parameters:

| Parameter                  | Value   |
|:---------------------------|:--------|
| Database Tested            | MONGO   |
| Number of Trials           | 1000    |
| Length of Each Entry Field | 10      |
| Number of Nodes in Cluster | 3       |

These results were obtained:

| Operation   |   Average |   St. Dev. |   Max Time |   Min Time |   Range |
|:------------|----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|--------:|
| Writes      |   0.00110 |    0.00047 |    0.00646 |    0.00055 | 0.00592 |
| Reads       |   0.00115 |    0.00052 |    0.00733 |    0.00049 | 0.00683 |

This plot shows the normalized speeds of reads and writes over the course of the benchmark.  The data was normalized (i.e. any data points beyond 3 standard deviations of the mean were excluded).
