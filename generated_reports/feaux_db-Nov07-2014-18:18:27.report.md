RESULTS
=======

After using these parameters:

| Parameter                  | Value    |
|:---------------------------|:---------|
| Database Tested            | feaux_db |
| Number of Trials           | 1000     |
| Length of Each Entry Field | 10       |
| Number of Nodes in Cluster | 3        |

These results were obtained:

| Operation   |   Average |   St. Dev. |   Max Time |   Min Time |   Range |
|:------------|----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|--------:|
| Writes      |        48 |         16 |         99 |          0 |      99 |
| Reads       |        50 |         28 |         99 |          0 |      99 |

This plot shows the normalized speeds of reads and writes over the course of the benchmark.  The data was normalized (i.e. any data points beyond 3 standard deviations of the mean were excluded).
