RESULTS
=======

After using these parameters:

| Parameter                  | Value   |
|:---------------------------|:--------|
| Database Tested            | RIAK2   |
| Number of Trials           | 1000    |
| Length of Each Entry Field | 10      |
| Number of Nodes in Cluster | 3       |
| Split Reads and Writes     | True    |
| Debug Mode                 | False   |
| Chaos Mode (Random Reads)  | False   |

These results were obtained:

| Operation   |   Average |   St. Dev. |   Max Time |   Min Time |   Range |
|:------------|----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|--------:|
| Writes      |   0.00478 |    0.01351 |    0.43035 |    0.00265 | 0.42770 |
| Reads       |   0.00343 |    0.00982 |    0.30880 |    0.00143 | 0.30737 |

This plot shows the normalized speeds of reads and writes over the course of the benchmark.  The data was normalized (i.e. any data points beyond 3 standard deviations of the mean were excluded).
