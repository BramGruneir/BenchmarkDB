RESULTS
=======

After using these parameters:

| Parameter                  | Value   |
|:---------------------------|:--------|
| Database Tested            | MONGO   |
| Number of Trials           | 3000    |
| Length of Each Entry Field | 10      |
| Number of Nodes in Cluster | 3       |

These results were obtained:

| Operation   |   Average |   St. Dev. |   Max Time |   Min Time |   Range |
|:------------|----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|--------:|
| Writes      |   0.00217 |    0.00058 |    0.00763 |    0.00103 | 0.00660 |
| Reads       |   0.00982 |    0.00571 |    0.08787 |    0.00095 | 0.08692 |

This plot shows the normalized speeds of reads and writes over the course of the benchmark.  The data was normalized (i.e. any data points beyond 3 standard deviations of the mean were excluded).
