RESULTS
=======

After using these parameters:

| Parameter                  | Value   |
|:---------------------------|:--------|
| Database Tested            | MONGO   |
| Number of Trials           | 3000    |
| Length of Each Entry Field | 10      |
| Number of Nodes in Cluster | 3       |

These results were obtained:

| Operation   |   Average |   St. Dev. |   Max Time |   Min Time |   Range |
|:------------|----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|--------:|
| Writes      |   0.00228 |    0.00165 |    0.08326 |    0.00097 | 0.08229 |
| Reads       |   0.00924 |    0.00611 |    0.07863 |    0.00073 | 0.07790 |

This plot shows the normalized speeds of reads and writes over the course of the benchmark.  The data was normalized (i.e. any data points beyond 3 standard deviations of the mean were excluded).
