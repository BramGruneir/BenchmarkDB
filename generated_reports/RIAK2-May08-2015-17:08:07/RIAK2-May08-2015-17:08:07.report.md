RESULTS
=======

After using these parameters:

| Parameter                        | Value   |
|:---------------------------------|:--------|
| Database Tested                  | RIAK2   |
| Number of Trials                 | 10000   |
| Length of Each Entry Field       | 10      |
| Number of Nodes in Cluster       | 3       |
| # of StDev's Displayed in Graphs | 3       |
| Split Reads and Writes           | True    |
| Debug Mode                       | False   |
| Chaos Mode (Random Reads)        | False   |

These results were obtained:

| Operation   |   Average |   St. Dev. |   Max Time |   Min Time |   Range |
|:------------|----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|--------:|
| Writes      |   0.00366 |    0.00564 |    0.32191 |    0.00180 | 0.32011 |
| Reads       |   0.00343 |    0.00255 |    0.05884 |    0.00110 | 0.05774 |

This plot shows the normalized speeds of reads and writes over the course of the benchmark.  The data was normalized (i.e. any data points beyond 3 standard deviations of the mean were excluded).
