RESULTS
=======

After using these parameters:

| Parameter                  | Value   |
|:---------------------------|:--------|
| Database Tested            | RIAK2   |
| Number of Trials           | 10000   |
| Length of Each Entry Field | 10      |
| Number of Nodes in Cluster | 3       |
| Split Reads and Writes     | True    |
| Debug Mode                 | False   |
| Chaos Mode (Random Reads)  | True    |

These results were obtained:

| Operation   |   Average |   St. Dev. |   Max Time |   Min Time |   Range |
|:------------|----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|--------:|
| Writes      |   0.00507 |    0.00430 |    0.40052 |    0.00234 | 0.39818 |
| Reads       |   0.00390 |    0.00144 |    0.01713 |    0.00137 | 0.01576 |

This plot shows the normalized speeds of reads and writes over the course of the benchmark.  The data was normalized (i.e. any data points beyond 3 standard deviations of the mean were excluded).
