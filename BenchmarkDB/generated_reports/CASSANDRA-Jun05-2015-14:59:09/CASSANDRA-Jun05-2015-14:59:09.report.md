RESULTS
=======

After using these parameters:

| Parameter                          | Value     |
|:-----------------------------------|:----------|
| Database Tested                    | CASSANDRA |
| Number of Trials                   | 1000      |
| Length of Each Entry Field         | 10        |
| Number of Nodes in Cluster         | 1         |
| # of StDev's Displayed in Graphs   | 3         |
| Range of Rolling Average in Graphs | 100       |
| Split Reads and Writes             | True      |
| Debug Mode                         | False     |
| Chaos Mode (Random Reads)          | False     |

These results were obtained:

| Operation   |   Average |   St. Dev. |   Max Time |   Min Time |   Range |
|:------------|----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|--------:|
| Writes      |   0.00611 |    0.00339 |    0.03892 |    0.00361 | 0.03531 |
| Reads       |   0.00744 |    0.00376 |    0.04059 |    0.00352 | 0.03707 |

This plot shows the normalized speeds of reads and writes over the course of the benchmark.  The data was normalized (i.e. any data points beyond 3 standard deviations of the mean were excluded).
