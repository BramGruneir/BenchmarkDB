RESULTS
=======

After using these parameters:

| Parameter                        | Value     |
|:---------------------------------|:----------|
| Database Tested                  | CASSANDRA |
| Number of Trials                 | 10000     |
| Length of Each Entry Field       | 10        |
| Number of Nodes in Cluster       | 1         |
| # of StDev's Displayed in Graphs | 3         |
| Split Reads and Writes           | True      |
| Debug Mode                       | False     |
| Chaos Mode (Random Reads)        | False     |

These results were obtained:

| Operation   |   Average |   St. Dev. |   Max Time |   Min Time |   Range |
|:------------|----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|--------:|
| Writes      |   0.00558 |    0.00344 |    0.03832 |    0.00166 | 0.03666 |
| Reads       |   0.00595 |    0.00463 |    0.12017 |    0.00190 | 0.11827 |

This plot shows the normalized speeds of reads and writes over the course of the benchmark.  The data was normalized (i.e. any data points beyond 3 standard deviations of the mean were excluded).
