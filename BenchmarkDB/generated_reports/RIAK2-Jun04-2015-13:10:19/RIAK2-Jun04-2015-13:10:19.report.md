RESULTS
=======

After using these parameters:

| Parameter                          | Value   |
|:-----------------------------------|:--------|
| Database Tested                    | RIAK2   |
| Number of Trials                   | 1000    |
| Length of Each Entry Field         | 10      |
| Number of Nodes in Cluster         | 3       |
| # of StDev's Displayed in Graphs   | 3       |
| Range of Rolling Average in Graphs | 100     |
| Split Reads and Writes             | True    |
| Debug Mode                         | False   |
| Chaos Mode (Random Reads)          | False   |

These results were obtained:

| Operation   |   Average |   St. Dev. |   Max Time |   Min Time |   Range |
|:------------|----------:|-----------:|-----------:|-----------:|--------:|
| Writes      |   0.00357 |    0.00137 |    0.01251 |    0.00189 | 0.01061 |
| Reads       |   0.00303 |    0.00171 |    0.01270 |    0.00119 | 0.01151 |

This plot shows the normalized speeds of reads and writes over the course of the benchmark.  The data was normalized (i.e. any data points beyond 3 standard deviations of the mean were excluded).
